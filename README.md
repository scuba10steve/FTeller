## FTeller Project
This project is designed as essentially a clone of the Akinator app.  This portion of the app is the backend.

## Next Steps
This skeleton includes `TODO` markers to help you find basic areas you will want
to customize.

### Relational Databases and Datastore
To add persistence to your models, use
[NDB](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/) for
scale.  Consider
[CloudSQL](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql)
if you need a relational database.

### Installing Libraries
See the [Third party
libraries](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27)
page for libraries that are already included in the SDK.  To include SDK
libraries, add them in your app.yaml file. Other than libraries included in
the SDK, only pure python libraries may be added to an App Engine project.
